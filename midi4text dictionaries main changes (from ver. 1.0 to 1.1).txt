MIDI4TEXT Changes in main and brief dictionary 

(from 1.0 to 1.3 version)

- corrected the entry for “and”
	in the main dictionary there was the entry uacf=and, while in the brief dictionary there are the entries FN=and, Rnf =and. No space prefix entry anf={and^} was wrongly written "{and" (there weren't the closing curly bracket and the caret). 

- corrected the brief for "part"
	"prat" is a legitimate word, so it cannot used for a brief. Mapped "part" as "rpat"

- the word "cue" come out as "que".
	mapped in the brief dictionary CPUue=cue

- introduced  CXIU for beginning sch^. 
	also modified the previous CXIU=sk^ in ZXIU=sk^


- changed the brief for "about" which now is RIieapf 
	(^bout" is a word and a word part)


- changed SCPuienzf = don't.  
	dont is a word part.  A rarely used one, but it's inconsistent Now is RIUuienzf = don't. 


- introduced prefix SIins = sign^. 
	though for a few words (signpost, signposts, signboard, signboards, signposted, signposting), I think it's a good rule of the thumb to introduce also the prefix form for any brief which acts also as a suffix whenever it doesn't conflict with anything.

-  the brief for 'you' is Iu not IU as written. 
	corrected in the brief dictionary: it was intended to be IU, so I=I and you=IU
